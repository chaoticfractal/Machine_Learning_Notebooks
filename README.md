# Machine_Learning_Notebooks
This repo will contain Jupyter notebooks that contain exercises from Aurelien Geron's machine learning book("Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow") that I have wrote myself. Keep in mind that all file paths that are used are going to replaces with placeholders. If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesistate to contact me.
