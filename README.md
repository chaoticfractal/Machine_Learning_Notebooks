# Machine_Learning_Notebooks
This repo will contain Jupyter notebooks that contain exercises from Aurelien Geron's machine learning book("Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow") that I have wrote myself. Keep in mind that all file paths that are used without using the OS library to call the current directory will be replaced by a placeholder ("<dir>"). If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesistate to contact me.
