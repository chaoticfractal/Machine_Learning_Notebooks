# Machine_Learning_Notebooks
This repo will contain Jupyter notebooks that contain excercie solutions/projects from Aurelien Geron's machine learning book("Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow") that I have wrote myself along with other projects that I intend to create later on. The notebooks will be written in Python version 2.7. Keep in mind that all file paths that are used without using the OS library to call the current directory will be replaced by a placeholder ("\<dir>\"). Also when viewing the notebook on Github there might be some formatting issues with the comments in some cells but should be properly formatted if the notebook is downloaded and ran on a local machine. If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesistate to contact me.
